A multi-sensor benchmark dataset for detecting individual trees in airborne RGB, Hyperspectral and LIDAR point clouds

[![Travis-CI Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/Weecology/neontreeevaluation_python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Weecology/neontreeevaluation_python)


 Maintainers: Dylan Stewart and Ben Weinstein - University of Florida.

 This benchmark dataset contains a consistent annotation approach across a variety of ecosystems. There are three types of annotated data:

## Image-annotated Crowns

 The main data source are image-annotated crowns, in which a single observer annotated visible trees in 200 40m x 40m images from across the United States.

## Field-annotated Crowns

 The second data source is a small number of field-deliniated crowns from three geographic sites. These crowns were drawn on a tablet while physically standing in the field, thereby reducing the uncertainty in crown segmentation.

## Field Stems

 The third data source is the NEON Woody Vegetation Structure Dataset. Each tree stem is represented by a single point. This data has been filtered to represent overstory trees visible in the remote sensing imagery.
